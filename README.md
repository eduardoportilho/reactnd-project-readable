# Readable

This is my implementation for the final assessment project for Udacity's Redux course. The app is a content and comment web app. Users are able to post content to predefined categories, comment on their posts and other users' posts, and vote on posts and comments. Users are also able to edit and delete posts and comments.

## Running de application

To run the application, follow this steps:

- Clone or download the [project repository](https://github.com/eduardoportilho/reactnd-project-readable).

- Install and start the API server
  - `cd reactnd-project-readable/api-server/`
  - `npm install`
  - `node server`
- In another terminal window, install an run the frontend application
  - `cd reactnd-project-readable/frontend`
  - `npm install`
  - `npm start`

## API Server

Information about the API server and how to use it can be found in its [README file](api-server/README.md).
